## Why you should track your diet?

Tracking your diet helps you build better eating habits, achieve health goals, and stay aware of your nutritional intake. Research shows that people who monitor their food tend to make healthier choices and maintain weight more effectively.

* 📊 **Improve Awareness** – Understand what you eat and how it impacts your body. [CDC on Steps for Losing Weight](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-weight-growth/losing-weight/)
* 🎯 **Reach Health Goals** – Whether it’s losing weight, building muscle, or managing conditions like diabetes, tracking helps stay on course. [MUSC Health: Exploring the Benefits of Tracking Food Intake](https://muschealth.org/medical-services/weight-loss-surgery/wls/2024/01/exploring-the-benefits-of-tracking-food-intake)
* 🧠 **Create Mindful Habits** – Logging food encourages mindfulness and reduces overeating. [Harvard: Importance of mindful eating](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/mindful-eating/)

With Piku Diet, you just speak or type, and AI handles the rest—making tracking effortless.
